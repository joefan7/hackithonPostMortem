What went right?
    - after a few starts and stops we were able to use git
    - each team member contributed based on their strength
    - usage of Trello to manage action items
    - We won ! ! ! ! :)

What did you learn?
    - FaceBook login SDK
    - Different TAs have different styles in solving issues
    - how to start a project without Vue then with Vue and then ripping Vue out again
    - clear communication is needed between team members when merging and pushing code to git

How could you have improved the experience?
    - implement the Mobile first methodology
    - make the app multiuser

What environmental factors contributed to the success/failure
    - referring back to class notes helped greatly
    - started quickly over the weekend at a team members home

What went wrong, and how can you avoid these things in the future?
    - a key piece of code was lost during a git push which pushed us back a few hours. Implementing TDD (Test Driven Development) may help catch this sooner.

What questions did this project raise for you?
    - how can I clearly define the requirements/scope of functionality of the project and keep development on track?

What concepts from this project do you now feel like you really know?
    - "created" section of Vue
    - Facebook Login SDK

What concepts are still somewhat fuzzy for you?
    - event handlers within and outside of Vue

What concepts seem like they're still out of reach?
    - none, there are enough resources externally and from our notes to help with understanding the concepts we have been using.
